# messagesDispatcher

Welcome to messagesDispatcher. 

The task that was given me consisted of creaing an api from scratch, the api should be able to save messages
into an array and will let the user know if the message that was given to him is a palindrome or not.

1. to run the app on your enviorment you should have node.js and express installed.
2. nodemon is optional.
3. open the file on webstorm / any other idea which you are familier with. 
4. in the terminal write: nodemon MessageDispatcher.js / run the code in other way if you don't have nodemon on your machine.
   after running the application you can now go to one of the following adresses:
   <br />
   a. http://localhost:3000/  - landing page
   <br />
   b. http://localhost:3000/api - api documentation
   <br />
   c. http://localhost:3000/api/messages - page where messages will appear.
   Please note that at the beggining there are not messages and you will need to post some in order to see them (read documentation)
   <br />
   d. http://localhost:3000/api/messages/:id - specific message (u will need to write the real message id instead of ":id" in the url.
